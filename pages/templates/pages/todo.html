<h2>
    This has a 'new' revamped purpose!
</h2>
<p>
    The importance of breaking down a large goal is to make it into manageable parts. Interestingly enough
    if the goal is not big enough to have a purpose that emboldens me to continue with it, then it is too small.
    This connects back to knowing myself. The more ambitious I am the bigger the goal is. This has proven itslef to be
    the biggest driver in size adn driving force for me. Being adventurous was the second. Though am I the same person
    I used to be when I cooked up the real business idea for this? That would prove me wrong in having said this, but
    somehow leave me with a good aftertaste, adventure would then remain the biggest driving force, and in doing
    this the biggest purveyor of purpose adn elan vitar.

<h3>The business idea</h3>
<p>
    It all started with a savings app. To create a crowdsavings app that would allow people to show they have "skin
    in the game", by aiming to save about 20% themselves and crowdfund the rest in donations and rewards.

    However the source of funds doesn't matter that much. Meaning that it can be also a loan or equity. And of course,
    having regular, if not at least recurring donations also brings in a substantial amount of funds.

    Once those funds are collected, something can be planned to do with them. Simple payout, buy something,
    build something, invest in something. Of course, the level of complexity in having said this like that, grows
    exponentially with every word basically.

    How very interesting though, that now that I am at a point where I have a good shot in creating an MVP for this in
    great, robust framework, I also learn that to create a business model, the underlying structure of it needs to be
    given first. That is to say, be able to open accounts and deposit funds in them. I had to be able to create this
    first, before being able to start implementing my business idea and consequenting model; and it will be yet another
    interesting task to execute and operate it.
